firebase & emulator issues:
sometimes emulator stops working beacuse it has trouble communication with firebase. Please stop and run again
app functionality might take longer to load sometimes. 
specifically in the classes tab, if more information is not displayed by clicking on the toggle button, might have to click a couple more time for it to show up
